# Heat Cost Allocator (HCA) heating meters readings script
PowerShell script to get readings of Heat Cost Allocators ([doprimo-3 heating meters](https://www.ista.com/uk-2023/technology/heat-cost-allocators/)) operated by `ista Nederland B.V.` on a **per day**, **per billing period** and **per meter** basis.

This is an unofficial script. The official API is not documented and the script is based on reverse-engineering the API calls made by the official portal. Use it as your own risk and responsibility. No liability is assumed for any damages or losses caused by the use of this script.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daniel0x00/HeatCostAllocator.git
```

## Requirements 
- PowerShell 7 or higher, [available for Windows, MacOS and Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4).

## Usage
- Add your credentials to the [ista Nederland B.V. login portal](https://mijn.ista.nl/home/index) on the `usage.ps1` file, vars `$Username` and `$Password`. ([Don't have an account?](https://mijn.ista.nl/RegisterNewUser)).
- Adjust the billing period in the `usage.ps1` file if needed, on the vars `$BillingPeriodYear`, `$startDate` and `$endDate`.
- By default, the script will get the heating readings broken down by day and by the full billing period. 
- It is recommended to export once a week: **every Tuesday night**. If you schedule the execution of `usage.ps1` in a cron job to every Tuesday, you will export **both** the readings as a **daily basis** (`DailyBasis` file) as well as the **full billing period** (`FullPeriodBasis` file).
- The `FullPeriodBasis` file will match what is shown in the portal.
- Run the script by dot-sourcing it:

```powershell
PS > . .\usage.ps1

# This will create two CSV files with the readings of the radiator's Heat Cost Allocators in your current directory: one with daily-basis readings and another with full-period readings.
# E.g.:
# `DailyBasis_BillingPeriodYear_2024_ExportedAt_2024-12-31_HCAReadings.csv`
# `FullPeriodBasis_BillingPeriodYear_2024_ExportedAt_2024-12-31_HCAReadings.csv`
# You also have available the variables `$dailyData` and `$fullData` which contains the readings as PowerShell object.
```

```powershell
PS > . .\usage.ps1
PS > $fullData | select -Last 1 | fl

## Column explanation

Unofficial (best-guess effort) explanation of the columns generated by the script.

| Column | Description | Belongs to official API? |
|---|---|---|
| CurEndTimestamp | Represents the time in Unix format of the `CurEnd` date. Output as first column, so a Big Data tool (like Splunk) picks it up as event time. | No. Introduced as a helper column. |
| RequestedAtTimestamp | Represents the time at which the request was made to the API. | No. Introduced as a helper column. |
| RequestedBillingPeriodYear | Represents the billing period parameter passed to the API requests. | No. Introduced as a helper column. The API will output `BillingPeriodId` on the response. |
| Period | Represents the period of export. Can be `Daily` -indicating daily readings- or `Full` -indicating full billing period readings-. | No. Introduced as a helper column. |
| BeginValue | Meter reading as it was seen on `BsDate` date. | Yes |
| EndValue | Meter reading as it was seen on `EsDate` date. | Yes |
| CValue | Difference `EndValue`-`BeginValue` | Yes |
| CCDValue | This is the amount of units you're going to be billed for, after the application of `Reduction`, `CalcFactor` and `Multiply`. **IMPORTANT**: this value **CANNOT** be used on the `DailyBasis` export as the calculation will be different than on the `FullPeriod` export. | Yes |
| TransferLoss | Refers to heat transfer losses associated with the measurement process. It accounts for the heat that is lost during the transfer of energy from the radiator to the environment, which might not directly contribute to the actual heating of the room. It can be a set value or a formula. Since my radiators all have a `TransferLoss` of `0`, I cannot determine it's usage. | Yes |
| DecPos | Decimal position, determines the number of decimal places shown in the displayed value. Example: DecPos = 2 means 123.45; DecPos = 0 means 123. | Yes |
| SValR | Scaling value for radiators, adjusts for specific radiator heat output. Typically determined based on radiator type, size, and heat output. Example: Larger radiators → Higher SValR. Unknown usage. Since my radiators all have a `SValR` of `0`, I cannot determine it's usage. | Yes |
| EvalR | Evaluation factor. All my radiadors do have a value of `92`. Unknown usage. | Yes |

## Billing explanation

Unofficial (best-guess effort) explanation on how the billing is calculated:
1. Billing is based on the readings of the **full billing period**.
2. To get a **list of available billing periods** for your account —which also represents how far back can you go in time in your account—, you can use:
```powershell
(New-HCASession -LoginUrl $LoginUrl -Username $Username -Password $Password | Get-HCAUser -UserUrl $UserUrl).User.Cus | ForEach-Object { $_.curConsumption | ForEach-Object { $_.BillingPeriods | Format-List } }
```
```powershell
y  : 2025
s  : 7/1/2024 12:00:00 AM
e  : 6/30/2025 12:00:00 AM
ta : 12.7

y  : 2024
s  : 7/1/2023 12:00:00 AM
e  : 6/30/2024 12:00:00 AM
ta : 11.6

y  : 2023
s  : 7/1/2022 12:00:00 AM
e  : 6/30/2023 12:00:00 AM
ta : 10.3

y  : 2022

1. To download a specific billing period, you can modify the `usage.ps1` file and run it as explained in the `Usage` section. You only need to change the `$BillingPeriodYear`, `$startDate` and `$endDate` variables with the values obtained in step #2. Of course, `$Username` and `$Password` must be set as well.
2. You're billed for the Units shown on the `CCDValue` column. This value is calculated as follows:
   - `(EndValue - BeginValue) * Multiply * CalcFactor * ((100 - Reduction) / 100)`, then rounded to the nearest integer, as value `DecPos` enforces.
3. You cannot use daily exports to calculate the billing. The `CCDValue` will be different on the daily export than on the full billing period export. The daily export is only useful to see the daily consumption of the radiators —**for example to see if meters are measuring `0` on `CCDValue` if you have the heating turned off**—, but not to calculate the billing. This is explained because if you apply the same formula as shown above on a 'per-day basis', it will be different than the formula applied on the 'full billing period'. In other words, the `CCDValue` value on the 'full billing period' is smaller than the sum of all `CCDValue` exported as a daily basis, thus the `EUR` value to pay is also smaller.
3. The `EUR` price of the unit is determined by `ista Nedarland B.V.` and is not shown on the API response. You can call them to get the price per unit, per billing period, after the billing period has ended. For the billing period `2023` (one of the highest ever), the price was `0.95 EUR/unit`. (TODO: currently figuring out if this value is present on the [debicasso portal](https://debicasso.istanederland.nl/login)).
